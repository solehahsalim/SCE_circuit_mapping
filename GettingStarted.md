## Tasks Before You Get Started:
1. If you don't already have one, __set up your GitHub Account__:  https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/ 
   * We recommend you use a professional string for your user name that your colleagues will be able to use to easily idenfity you.
