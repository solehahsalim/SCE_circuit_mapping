# Distribution Circuit Mapping
The UC Davis Energy Economics Program is creating publically available electricty distribution maps to study the impacts to reliability of the electricity distribution system with increasing market penetration of solar electric generation and electric vehicles.

This Github repository collects and merges the spatial data for electricty distribution systems.

## Overview
A combination of technological changes and shifting environmental priorities is placing new and powerful stresses upon the traditional model of electricity distribution services. Declining load growth and increasing “behind the meter” supply are making it difficult for utilities to recover distribution costs that are largely fixed and sunk. Despite the pressures of changing technology, growing concern about climate change is leading policy-makers to place even further emphasis on energy efficiency and the expansion of renewable energy. The dramatic growth in the adoption of distributed energy resources by utility customers, expanding penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), and increased consumer interest in exercising more personal choice over their retail energy decisions, among other developments, have added new and powerful stresses upon the traditional model of electric utility service. While these fundamental changes may weigh heavily on the minds of policy-makers and industry participants, there has been a limited contribution of independent research from academia on emerging problems in electricity distribution. There has also been little empirical research using actual historical utility data, as opposed to simulation data.

## Goals of the Project
1. In what ways has the deployment of DER in California impacted historical power quality (voltage, reliability) metrics?
1. How do community level socioeconomic indicators such as income and race correlate with
    1. DER power quality impacts
    1. DER integration capacities
1. How will changing DER deployment trends – e.g. more EVs, more community solar – impact distribution system performance?
1. To what extent can new siting and / or real time control protocols reduce distribution system impacts?
