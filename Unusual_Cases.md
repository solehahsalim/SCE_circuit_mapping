# How to delineate unusual circuits

Below is a decription of what to do in unusual delineation scenarios, and in cases accompanying pictures as guidance (but please use your best judgement in the particular scenario).

**... Still to come**

Things to include:
  * Minimum distance between lines is a good starting point (the midpoint between circuits)
  * Some circuits may overlap, and this is unavoidable
  * Determine strange events
  * Be sure to email with questions if you find an unusual case
